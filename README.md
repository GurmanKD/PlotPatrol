Unauthorized construction poses significant challenges for the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), often making it a cumbersome and resource-intensive issue to address. PlotPatrol is designed to transform this challenge into a streamlined and efficient process.

With PlotPatrol, detecting anomalies in construction becomes effortless. From extended balconies and excessive height violations to illegal land usage, our solution can identify it all. Our portal offers comprehensive tools, including the ability to convert 2D images into immersive 3D models directly in-house and digitize 25-year-old paper maps into .dwf files.

PlotPatrol excels in segmenting and flagging inconsistencies in 3D models, 2D images, or satellite views, providing MCD with actionable insights. Additionally, our advanced drone mapping system offers detailed stage-wise building outlines and 3D model summaries, making it convenient for MCD to manage disputes, complaints, and violations.
